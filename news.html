                <h1>A Happy Neymar Turns PSG Into Genuinely-Scary European Contenders</h1>
                <p>A happy Neymar is a dangerous thing. At least for the other teams that are left in this year’s Champions League.
                    With there being no serious competition in the French domestic league, success in Paris is only measured against Champions League glory. This could be the year where that finally happens.
                </p>
                <p>A front four of Neymar, Mbappe, Icardi, and DiMaria is a scary prospect for any opposition. PSG’s primary failing is that its results on the pitch haven’t been greater than the sum of their individual parts.
                    This season could be different. Neymar is often pictured out on the town with French superstar Kylian Mbappe. And long gone are the days when pushing matches took place over who was taking a penalty.
                </p>
                <p> With an expensively assembled team all playing for each other under a coach known for his tactical acumen, PSG is one of the serious favorites for this season’s Champions League.
                    With ongoing reports suggesting that Mbappe will one day leave for Real Madrid, perhaps Neymar is realizing that being King of Paris isn’t that bad of a proposition after all.
